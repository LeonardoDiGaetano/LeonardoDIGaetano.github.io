**My teaching philosophy**
As a teacher, my philosophy is centered around empowering students to understand and engage with the material in a meaningful way. I believe in the maieutic process of teaching, which is a method of helping students to discover knowledge for themselves, rather than simply transmitting knowledge. To achieve this, I strive to connect with my students on a personal level, understand their unique needs and difficulties, and be flexible in my approach.

I firmly believe in the importance of creating a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students. This includes actively addressing issues of equity and diversity, creating a culture of respect and open communication, and promoting mindfulness, self-awareness and emotional regulation practices, to help students to manage stress, anxiety, biases, mental blocks, and insecurity.

In addition, I specialize in making math accessible to non-math majors by introducing the beauty of math in a simple and relatable way. I believe that true understanding comes from being able to explain a concept even to a child, as the famous physicist Richard Feynman said "I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."

I incorporate elements of fun, dialogue, group projects and other interactive strategies to encourage active learning, rather than passive absorption of information. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, rather than just listening, and that the best students are those who are genuinely interested in the subject matter and eager to explore it further.

My ultimate goal is to inspire and empower students to become lifelong learners and critical thinkers. I believe that by fostering a positive, relaxed, and inclusive learning environment, and by encouraging active engagement and curiosity, students will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the material, and develop the skills they need to succeed in their future endeavors.
