I am a physicist with a dedicated focus on network science, particularly in its application to brain networks and social systems. 

I am currently a PhD student in the department of [Network and data science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) @ [CEU](https://www.ceu.edu/) under the supervision of Federico Battiston.

Previously, I have done my master degree at University of Catania under the supervision of Vito Latora and Lucas Lacasa.
