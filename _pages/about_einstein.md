I am a physicist specializing in network science, with specific emphasis on the analysis of brain networks and social systems.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in [Network and Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/), under the guidance of [Federico Battiston](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=aDf1nroAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Prior to this, I completed my master's degree at the University of Catania, where I was supervised by [Vito Latora](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jXTPa_AAAAAJ&hl) and Lucas Lacasa.
