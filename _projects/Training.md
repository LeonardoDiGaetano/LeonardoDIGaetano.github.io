My passion for teaching began at a very young age. Since high school, I have been dedicated to helping my peers understand and excel in mathematics and scientific subjects. This early experience solidified my commitment to education and sparked my desire to pursue a career in teaching.

One of the main reasons I enrolled in a PhD program was to fulfill my aspiration of teaching at a higher level. 

During my doctoral studies, I seized the opportunity to enhance my teaching skills by enrolling in the Teaching Certificate program offered by the Yehuda Elkana Center for Teaching at CEU. 


## Teaching Certificate

The Teaching Certificate program included a variety of courses designed to develop essential teaching skills. 

Here are the elective courses I completed:

### Using an LMS (Moodle) for Teaching and Assessment

In the "Using an LMS (Moodle) for Teaching and Assessment" course, I gained expertise in leveraging Moodle, a widely used Learning Management System, to enhance my teaching and assessment practices. Key skills and knowledge acquired include:
- **Course Management**: How to effectively organize course materials, create interactive learning modules, and manage student enrollments and communications within Moodle.
- **Assessment Tools**: Utilization of Moodle's assessment features, such as quizzes, assignments, and gradebook functionalities, to monitor and evaluate student progress.
- **Engagement Techniques**: Strategies to foster student engagement through forums, wikis, and other collaborative tools available on the Moodle platform.

### Supervising Undergraduate Research

The "Supervising Undergraduate Research" course equipped me with the necessary skills to mentor and guide undergraduate students through their research projects. Key takeaways from this course include:
- **Research Planning**: Techniques for helping students develop research proposals, set achievable goals, and create realistic timelines for their projects.
- **Mentorship**: Best practices for providing constructive feedback, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging independent research skills.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring that students adhere to ethical standards in their research, including proper citation practices and considerations for human subjects research.
