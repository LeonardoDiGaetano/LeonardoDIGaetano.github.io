  <p style="color: white;">My passion for teaching began at a very young age. Since high school, I have been dedicated to helping my peers understand and excel in mathematics and scientific subjects. This early experience solidified my commitment to education and sparked my desire to pursue a career in teaching.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">One of the main reasons I enrolled in a PhD program was to fulfill my aspiration of teaching at a higher level.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">During my doctoral studies, I seized the opportunity to enhance my teaching skills by enrolling in the Teaching Certificate program offered by the Yehuda Elkana Center for Teaching at CEU.</p>

  <h3 style="color: white;">Using an LMS (Moodle) for Teaching and Assessment</h3>
  <p style="color: white;">In the "Using an LMS (Moodle) for Teaching and Assessment" course, I gained expertise in leveraging Moodle, a widely used Learning Management System, to enhance my teaching and assessment practices. Key skills and knowledge acquired include:</p>
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li><strong>Course Management</strong>: How to effectively organize course materials, create interactive learning modules, and manage student enrollments and communications within Moodle.</li>
    <li><strong>Assessment Tools</strong>: Utilization of Moodle's assessment features, such as quizzes, assignments, and gradebook functionalities, to monitor and evaluate student progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement Techniques</strong>: Strategies to foster student engagement through forums, wikis, and other collaborative tools available on the Moodle platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: white;">Supervising Undergraduate Research</h3>
  <p style="color: white;">The "Supervising Undergraduate Research" course equipped me with the necessary skills to mentor and guide undergraduate students through their research projects. Key takeaways from this course include:</p>
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li><strong>Research Planning</strong>: Techniques for helping students develop research proposals, set achievable goals, and create realistic timelines for their projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship</strong>: Best practices for providing constructive feedback, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging independent research skills.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>: Ensuring that students adhere to ethical standards in their research, including proper citation practices and considerations for human subjects research.</li>
  </ul>

### Reflections and Improvements

Part of the teaching certificate consisted on teaching-observation class. I received valuable feedback for one of my classes that has significantly impacted my teaching approach. Here are the key reflections and improvements I have made:

  <h3 style="color: white;">Reflections on Peer Observation</h3>
  <p style="color: white;">The observation highlighted several strengths in my teaching, such as engaging students through interactive activities and maintaining a professional yet entertaining approach. However, it also identified areas for improvement, particularly in session structure, time management, and clarity of learning outcomes.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">Based on this feedback, I have made several changes to enhance my teaching practice:</p>
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li><strong>Improved Session Structure:</strong> I now ensure that each session begins with a clear introduction, outlining the learning outcomes and the session plan. This provides context and sets expectations for students.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Time Management:</strong> I have worked on better organizing my lesson plans to allow for pauses, transitions, and student questions. This includes pruning content to avoid rushing and ensuring a smoother flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Clearer Learning Outcomes:</strong> I have refined my learning outcomes to be more specific and measurable. This helps in setting clear expectations and assessing whether students have achieved the desired knowledge and skills.</li>
  </ul>
