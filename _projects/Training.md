  <p style="color: white;">My passion for teaching began at a very young age. Since high school, I have been dedicated to helping my peers understand and excel in mathematics and scientific subjects. This early experience solidified my commitment to education and sparked my desire to pursue a career in teaching.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">One of the main reasons I enrolled in a PhD program was to fulfill my aspiration of teaching at a higher level.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">During my doctoral studies, I seized the opportunity to enhance my teaching skills by enrolling in the Teaching Certificate program offered by the Yehuda Elkana Center for Teaching at CEU.</p>
