  <h2 style="color: white;">Experience as a Data Scientist and Instructor</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">With extensive experience in both data science and teaching, I have honed my skills in analyzing complex data sets and conveying intricate concepts in an understandable manner. My journey as a data scientist has equipped me with the expertise to handle various data-driven projects, while my role as an instructor has allowed me to develop effective teaching strategies.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">I strive to teach data science in a modern way, incorporating interactive tasks and activities in class to stimulate student engagement. This approach not only enhances learning but also ensures that students can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">Analyzing Taylor Swift's Discography</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">In one of our interactive class sessions, we analyzed the discography of Taylor Swift using a Jupyter notebook. This hands-on activity allowed students to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset, enhancing their understanding of data processing, visualization, and interpretation.</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">[In-Class Survey Meta-Analysis](https://www.mentimeter.com/app/presentation/almw27xfb9irc3ammzfvsv6cyexv7q3p)</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">During the course, I conducted an in-class activity where students completed a survey to provide feedback on the course. We then performed a meta-analysis of the survey results to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching methods and identify areas for improvement. This activity not only helped me enhance the course but also taught students how to conduct and analyze surveys.</p>

  <h2 style="color: white;">Assessing Final Reports and Projects</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">I employ precise and fair methods to assess final reports and projects, ensuring that all students receive accurate evaluations of their work. The assessment criteria are clearly defined and communicated to students, focusing on the quality of analysis, clarity of presentation, and originality of the project.</p>
  <p style="color: white;">These assessments are designed to not only grade the students but also provide constructive feedback that can aid in their academic and professional growth.</p>
