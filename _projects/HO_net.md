I am interested in studying the structures and dynamics of higher order networks. Among my recent works are studies on percolation on temporal hypergraphs and the rare events of dynamics on hypergraphs.

## Temporal and topological properties of Higher-order networks

Among my recent research, I have delved into the temporal and topological properties of higher-order networks. The intricate dynamics and structure of these networks provide valuable insights into various applications.
